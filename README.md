# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

put gif here later

When the username entered exists in the user list but the password is incorrect, the text "Log in was unsuccessful" appears in bold and has a span class of "failure." However, if the username entered does not exist in the user list, then the text "Log in was unsuccessful" appears without bold and has a span class of "failed." The different classes probably have different CSS values.
